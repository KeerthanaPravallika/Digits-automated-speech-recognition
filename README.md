## ðŸ“œ Steps followed
1. Importing the dataset - ( and unzipping the folder) and creating a new folder Spectrograms
2. Converting the audio files into spectrograms as spectrogram will be unique for each digit
3. Spliting the data into training and testing data
4. Dividing training data to X_train(images), y_train(labels) and testing data to X_test(images), y_test(labels)
5. Converting into one hot representation and normalizing the images
6. Creating a CNN model of three layers of convolution
7. Training the data
8. Evaluation of data
9. Saving the model
10. Predicting for another sample
